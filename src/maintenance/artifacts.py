"""Phase 18.4: reference-aware artifact cleanup with quarantine.

``data/output/`` accumulates throughout normal use: every successful
materials generation drops resume+cover-letter files, every failed
``patch_existing`` run leaves a half-written ``patched_resume_<uuid>.docx``,
every form-fill attempt writes a screenshot, and every regeneration
keeps the prior artifact path live on the ``Application`` row.

The cleanup contract (see D028) is:

1. **Reference-based protection.** Before deleting anything we build
   a *protected set* of paths the database considers load-bearing:
   live ``Application.resume_version`` / ``cover_letter_version``,
   ``UserDocument.storage_path``, ``SourceResume.storage_path``,
   ``ReviewQueueEntry.materials_path`` and durable task artifact paths.
   Expired soft-deleted application artifacts are deliberately excluded
   even if an old task audit row still mentions them. Anything in the
   protected set is *never* touched by automatic cleanup.
2. **Classification.** Unprotected files are bucketed by
   :func:`classify_path` into ``tmp`` (half-written
   ``*.tmp`` siblings), ``failed_artifact`` (zero-byte / unreadable
   DOCX/PDF), ``screenshot`` (under ``data/output/screenshots``),
   ``version_log`` (under ``data/output/versions``), ``orphan_output``
   (everything else under ``data/output`` directly), or ``unknown``.
3. **Quarantine.** Eligible files are *moved* into
   ``data/quarantine/<run_id>/...`` mirroring their relative path
   under ``data/output``. Permanent deletion only happens after the
   ``cleanup.quarantine_days`` window when :func:`purge_quarantine`
   runs, so a wrongful delete is recoverable for a week.
4. **Audit.** Every run inserts one :class:`CleanupRun` row plus one
   :class:`CleanupItem` per candidate so the operator can answer
   "what did cleanup do last Tuesday?" without grepping logs.

The same code drives both the scheduled
``maintenance.cache_eviction`` Beat task and the manual
``autoapply cleanup`` CLI -- there is intentionally no "manual rules"
fork.
